# Introduction
***

Since arriving at Columbia, I always knew that I wanted to work in the music industry. During my freshman year, I had my first taste of what it meant to work in music serving as an intern at the record label/distribution company, [iHipHop Distribution](http://ihiphopdistribution.com). At iHipHop, I was primarily tasked with building marketing plans, event planning, and A&R. A year into my intership, my boss started his own publishing company in order to claim the publishing rights of his label's expansive music collection. As an intern, I was responsible for managing the publishing and copyright registration for several albums, old and new. This experience proved to be invaluable and gave me a solid grasp on intellectual proprerty rights and the potential of publishing in regards to music. 

Typically, musicians do not need to be very concerned about publishing unless they are at the superstar level. This is because it can be difficult to secure licensing opportunities through film, television, advertising, and video games when you are a lesser known artist. With record sales in steady decline, publishing remains one of the most lucrative sources of income for artists but one of the most elusive for those who are up-and-coming. 

Realizing how beneficial publishing could be for artists, I set out to start my own publishing company last year with the goal of empowering up-and-coming artists who are often kept in the dark when it comes to licensing opportunities. With the age of the internet, content is being distributed at rapidly increasing rates. As a 21st century consumer, we have access to more television shows (broadcast and online), movies and video games than ever before. Because this content is often subsidized by advertising, our generation has become descentized to the increasing amount of advertisements we are shown on a daily basis. With all of this content in circulation, there are more publishing opportunities for artists to take advantage of these days, opening the doors for those who have not reached the superstar level.

As a publisher, it is your best interest to invest in the success of your artists, especially if they don't have an established fan base yet. In the case of publishing for up-and-comers, a publisher might have to assist their artist with other aspects of their music, like marketing and distribution. When I started my publishing company, [Reckless Abandon](http://rkls.co), I quickly found that it began to resemble a record label. Before I could even begin seeking out publishing opportunities, I would have to assist artists with designing album covers, getting press mentions, and hosting their music online, for example. As a publisher, having to provide label-like services is almost a neccessity, but one that often exhausts the resources of our small team, preventing us from putting our focus into creating publishing opportunities. 

Since going public with Reckless Abandon this year at SXSW, I have engaged in several conversations with music professionals about the company's goals. One conversation in particular really shook me and made me want to rethink my company's offerings. I consider myself a futurist and when starting Reckless, I wanted to create a company that was well-suited to tackle the music industry of the future. For me this meant being, quick and nimble (the perks of having a small, high quality team) and utilizing new technologies like online streaming and BitTorrent distribution. During one particular conversation, a music professional criticized me for not thinking futuristically enough and for simply applying newer technologies to a traditional (and potentially flawed) business model. 

While my thoughts are not fully developed, this conversation got me to start thinking about a different way of approaching a 21st century publishing company.   
    
# The Idea
---
Currently, Reckless Abandon works with a selective group of artists and serves as their exclusive publisher. In addition to allowing artists to maintain their copyrights, Reckless provides these artists with label services, in hope that they will become successful enough to take advantage of licensing opportunities. 

In a reimagining of the company, Reckless would be less selective and would open itself up to a larger pool of talent. The company would offer several tiers of service that artists would be able to buy into, some of which might become invite only. Many of the processes related to these services would be automated, freeing up time for Reckless' small team to focus on creating solid licensing opportunities for its most prized collections. In this scenario, artists would also maintain their copyrights. For many artists, Reckless would become a one-stop shop to take care of all of their musical needs.

# Prior Art
---
This potential restructuring of Reckless would provide the music community with more open access to musical resources. In the past, artists had to rely on a major record label to achieve any success in the music industry. Often, these labels would offer greater exposure in exchange for artists signing away many of their copyrights. With the internet, major labels are struggling to maintain their gatekeeper status as many useful tools become available to the general public. Reckless would provide a framework where artists could access these tools and then do with their music whatever they please. 

Currently companies like [TuneCore](http://www.tunecore.com/) and [CD Baby](http://members.cdbaby.com/) offer a wide variety of label-like services for artists in addition to publishing. In the past, these companies would charge yearly subscription fees and take cuts from record sales. As more companies started popping up that offered more for less (like [DistroKid](http://www.distrokid.com/)'s dirt-cheap distribution service that lets artists keep 100% of their sales), these companies have begun to adapt and are now offering a greater array of services while requiring less from their artists. As these companies begin to change their structure, I am worried that Reckless won't be able to differ itself. Everyone wants to become music's "one stop shop."

# Methods

To get the best understanding of the services a 21st century musician might require, I would engage in several discussions with not only musicians, but music consumers, publishers, DJs, and other members of the musical community. I would also research other competitors, the services they offer, and the success of the people they work with.

# Plan of Action
***

The conversation that made me rethink Reckless' direction only occurred a month ago and thus I have had not had the opportunity to develop my thoughts fully. I know for a fact that this new direction would only be possible with a robust task automator. Ideally the artist would log into our website, fill in some basic information, upload their music, and voila! On the backend, our task automator would go about sending music to iTunes, Spotify, etc., getting it in the hands of the press, and other tasks. In order to build the task automator, Reckless would have to hire at least one computer programmer with automation experience. 

Over the summer I plan to develop my ideas further with my two partners. Once our direction is solidified, we would go about seeking appropriate assistance.
